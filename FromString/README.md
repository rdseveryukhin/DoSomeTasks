In this task, you are asked to write a template function from_string that can convert a string to different types. To implement from_string, it is proposed to use the std::istringstream class, which is an input stream from a string, i.e. to convert a string to type T, it is proposed to read the value of type T from the stream using the >> operator. In case of an unsuccessful conversion, the function should throw a bad_from_string exception, the class of which you need to implement yourself.
